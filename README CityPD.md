### CityPD ###

This project contains a masked version of a consulting "market research" I performed on behalf of Social Impact Architects, an area impact assessment for a nonprofit opening a family violence shelter. My work accessing and utilizing data from several sources generated insights as to how their resources could be deployed to maximize impact.

DATA MASKING POLICY: 

In addition to removing the name of the client organization and the city, the police department and any other geographic details present in the scripts or files have been removed. This preserves the privacy of the victims and the shelter that represents them, while allowing me to show my thought process in code for providing new insights to the stakeholders involved.

I chose to show off this project, despite its sensitive subject matter, because it displays a top-to-bottom customized approach in extracting, transforming, and loading data from several external datasets into a visualization tool. 

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:

The subject of domestic violence, too, is in its own respect worthwhile discussing in public. Part of the work I did on this project was qualitative, and a good degree of the scholarship on this issue is critical of how domestic violence is seen as a "private" or "women's" issue. It wasn't until the feminists of the 1960s and 70s pushed for social intervention that domestic violence shelters became possible through a mix of philanthropic and government funding. Even still, many shelters around the United States, where this project was completed, face underresourced budgets or bare-minimum accomodations. 

There is a hope that sharing this work inspires action on a civic level. Remember that you, too, can help end domestic vioence through philanthropic donations, your vote at the local level, and your support of local nonprofit organizations in your community.
