### CityPD ###

This project contains a masked version of a consulting "market research" I performed on behalf of a family violence shelter organization as a contractor for Social Impact Architects, accessing and utilizing data from several sources to glean insights about where and how their resources could be deployed. 

DATA MASKING POLICY: 

In addition to removing the name of the organization and the city, the police department and any other geographic details present in the scripts or files have been removed. This preserves the privacy of the victims and the shelter that represents them, while allowing me to show my thought process in code for providing new insights to the stakeholders involved.

I chose to show off this project, despite its sensitive subject matter, because it displays a top-to-bottom customized approach in extracting, transforming, and loading data from an external database and into a visualization tool. 

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:

The subject of domestic violence, too, is in its own respect worthwhile discussing in public. Part of the work I did on this project was qualitative, and a good degree of the scholarship on this issue is critical of how domestic violence is seen as a "private" or "women's" issue. It wasn't until the feminists of the 1960s and 70s pushed for social intervention that domestic violence shelters became possible through a mix of philanthropic and government funding. Even still, many shelters around the United States, where this project was completed, face underresourced budgets or bare-minimum accomodations. 

There is a hope that sharing this work inspires action on a civic level. Remember that you, too, can help end domestic vioence through philanthropic donations, your vote at the local level, and your support of local organizations in your community.
